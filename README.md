# Classroom-Setup

So glad that you are in the *Intro to Learning Analytics* course. This is a guide for students to install R, RStudio desktop and GitHub Desktop for use with GitHub Classroom. We will be using GitHub Community and Classroom for Class instead of Moodle. There are several **steps** that will need to be followed in sequence. If you already have some of these programs please make sure they are up-to-date and move on to the one you do not. If you have all of them, then go enjoy some "Me" time!

- [ ] **INSTALL R programs**
- [ ] **SIGN up for GitHub and Install GitHub Desktop**
- [ ] **Create first Repository and pull via GitHub Desktop**
- [ ] **COnnect with the first assignment on GitHub Classroom**

##  ü§© Let's get started.....


### üé¨ STEP ONE: INSTALL R programs

- [ ] **First**, [Install R](https://cran.r-project.org/)
- [ ] **Second**, [Install R Studio Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) the Free version for your operating system.


### üèÅ STEP TWO: SIGN up for GitHub and Install GitHub Desktop

Now you will need to create a GitHub account. If you already have one, pleae continue to the next step.

- [ ] **Third**, [Create GitHub account](https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home) We recommend using a username that incorporates your name (ie: sbkellogg, jmcclure, sjiang)
